Here I used Librosa library which is popularly used for Audio Signal Processing because it helps to converge signals into monochannel, it can represent a audio signal in a normalize pattern (i.e between -1 to +1), so that a regular pattern is observed from all the audio signals and it can vizualize the sample rate.
Extract Features- Here I used Mel-Frequency Cepstral Cofficients(MFCC) from audio samples. MFCC summarises the frequency distribution across window size, so it is possible to analyse both frequency and time characteristics of the sound.These audio representations will allow us to identify features for classification.
